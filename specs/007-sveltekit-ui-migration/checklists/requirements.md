# Specification Quality Checklist: SvelteKit UI Migration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-07
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The framework is named only in the user's input line and the first assumption, because the request itself is to adopt it. Requirements and success criteria say "interface framework" and describe outcomes (parity, static delivery, offline, speed, checks).
- Static delivery, offline play, the 3 second budget and the simplicity justification come from the constitution (Principles II to IV and Technical Constraints), not from a design choice made here.
- Scope is bounded to the interface layer: the rules, computer opponent, saved-game format, replay and protocol modules are fixed.
- No clarification markers were needed. Defaults chosen: parity is the oracle, routes are added only because the framework provides them, the font stays non-blocking and uncached.
